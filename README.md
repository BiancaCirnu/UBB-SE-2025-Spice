## ðŸ“Œ About


This project is part of the **Software Engineering** course in the 4th semester at the **Computer Science** section of **BabeÈ™-Bolyai University**. The goal is to develop an application inspired by **Steam**, focusing on teamwork and collaboration.  





Our application manages user profiles, allowing users to:  


- Create and authenticate accounts  


- Earn achievements and points based on activity  


- Add funds to their accounts  


- Purchase features to enhance their profile's appearance


- Visualise their games and create collections of games





By working on this project, we aim to improve our software development skills while learning best practices for team collaboration.
